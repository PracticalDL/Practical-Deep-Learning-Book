    "As AI is automating more and more jobs, it can finally automate designing AI architectures too. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches utilize reinforcement learning to join together mini architectural blocks, till they are able to maximize the objective function - i.e. our validation accuracy. The current state of the art networks are all based on NAS, leaving human-designed architectures in the dust. Research in this area started showing promising results in 2017, with a bigger focus on making train faster in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoKeras (Haifeng Jin et al), also apply this state of the art technique on our particular datasets in a relatively accessible manner. Generating new model architectures with AutoKeras is a matter of supplying our images and associated labels, and a time limit to finish running the jobs by. Internally, it implements several optimization algorithms including a Bayesian optimization approach to search for an optimal architecture."
