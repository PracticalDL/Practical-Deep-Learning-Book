    "PCA (short for Principal Component Analysis) is a statistical procedure that questions if features representing the data are equally important. Are some of the features redundant enough that we can get similar results on say classification even after removing those features? PCA is considered one of the go-to techniques for dimensionality reduction. Note that it does not eliminate redundant features, instead it generates a new set of features that are a linear combination of the input features. These linear features are orthogonal to each other, which is why all the redundant features are absent. These features are known as principal components. \n",
