    "These mispredictions are what we want to reduce. Some of them are clearly wrong, while others are understandably confusing images. The sixth image (dog.4334) seems to be incorrectly labeled as a dog. Seventh and tenth images are difficult to distinguish against the background. The first and tenth lack enough texture within them to give the classifier enough identification power. And some of the dogs are too small, like the second and fourth."
