    "- **Organize the data**: Download labeled images of cats and dogs from Kaggle. Then divide the images into training and validation folders.\n",
    "- **Set up the configuration**: Define a pipeline for reading data, including preprocessing the images (e.g. resizing) and batching multiple images together.\n",
    "- **Load and augment the data**: In the absence of a ton of training images, make small changes (augmentation) like rotation, zooming, etc to increase variation in training data.\n",
    "- **Define the model**: Take a pre-trained model, remove the last few layers, and append a new classifier layer. Freeze the weights of original layers (i.e. make them unmodifiable). Select an optimizer algorithm and a metric to track (like accuracy).\n",

Choosing an optimal learning rate is crucial - a big value can cause the training process to jump around, missing the target. On the other hand, a tiny value can cause the training process to take ages to reach the target. We’ll keep it at 0.001 for now.\n",
